Programing:
Interpolation logic
Printing of the data (bonus?)


Bug Fixes:
Weird memory issues when pressing the button fast


Testing:
Make sure the wait timer in the events program is functioning like it should.

Make sure the data sent from the events program is received correctly at the
main program.

Make sure the data is placed into the interpolation array correctly.

Do the maths to validate interpolation.

Make sure the shit works.. Jesus.
